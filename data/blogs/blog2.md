After learning how to build web applications, I realised that I can use these skills to create a business. I was heavily inspired by Peter Levels, who in the quest of becoming self-sufficient bootstrapped startups in 12 months. I decided to build Apscend, a job application tracker for students applying to the investment banking industry.

### The Start: The Idea

I have previously worked in investment banking and know the ins and outs of the recruitment process. Most students apply to 20+ investment banks in the hopes of securing an investment banking position. The recruitment process is tedious and disorganized because all the banks have different application opening dates and requirements (e.g., video interviews and tests). -

Here's an example of a scenario where our team helps: a customer is happily using Wdesk until unexpectedly a button does not work like they expected it to. Immediately, an error is logged off and sent back to us. After navigating through the proper channels, it arrives and we process the error. Using logic that we've created, we answer questions like: Has this error happened before? How many times has it happened? Is it spinning out of control? Should we contact someone? After answering these questions, we typically end up sending out a message to the interested parties letting them know a user hit this error and giving them all the information they need to investigate it.

This workflow has streamlined the support process for a number of teams internally and has helped us produce a better product for our customers. We're constantly pushing the boundaries for improving the customer experience and providing a positive experience using our software.

### Our Campus

One of my favorite parts about Workiva is the campus. We have an unbelievable facility in Ames that is as beautiful as it is functional. Here are some of my favorite pictures.
