            Hey, Iâ€™m Hamish. My background is in finance, where I worked in
            investment banking and growth capital. I hold a Bachelors in
            International Business and a Masters in Finance from Maastricht
            University, Netherlands.

            Feeling unfulfilled during my time working in finance, I wanted to
            try out new things. I decided to have a go at coding and it
            immediately captivated me. I should have known coding was for me.
            After all, my favourite exercise when working in finance was
            financial modelling, which involved writing a lot of formulas on
            excel. Since February 2021, I've spent most of my free time learning
            computer science and web development. I am now looking to make the
            switch into a tech career. You can check out my current capabilities
            below:

            Armed with coding skills, I also realised that I can now build
            businesses. The concept of building profitable side projects is very
            appealing to me. I've built two SaaS products that I've released to
            the public so far,{" "}

            . Building these products has taught me about the importance of
            marketing, pricing and customer feedback when building products. As
            of September 2021, I plan on building at least one SaaS business per
            month in the hope of creating successful mini businesses that can
            generate me some side-income.

            I spend my free time doing sports, watching football and coding
            personal projects. I'm currently in based in Mauritius, but lived in
            the UK, Netherlands and Germany over the last 6 years. I am fluent
            in English and French.
